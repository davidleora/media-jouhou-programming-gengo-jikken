# C Programming Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning progress in C programming, starting from the basics and culminating in the creation of the card game 大富豪 (Daifugo) or 大貧民 (Daihinmin).

## Repository Contents

### Basics

- **Hello World**: Simple programs to understand the structure and syntax of C.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Exercises to learn about different data types and how to use variables.
- **Control Structures**: Programs demonstrating the use of if-else statements, loops, and switch cases.
- **Functions**: Examples of defining and calling functions, passing arguments, and returning values.
- **Arrays and Pointers**: Practice with arrays, pointers, and pointer arithmetic.
- **Structures**: Examples of defining and using structures to group related data.

### Advanced Topics

- **File I/O**: Programs to read from and write to files.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Practice with malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Data Structures**: Examples of stacks, queues, and binary trees.

### Project: 大富豪 (Daifugo) / 大貧民 (Daihinmin)

- **Game Rules**: Implementation of the rules of the game.
- **Card Handling**: Code to shuffle, deal, and manage cards.
- **Player Turns**: Logic for handling player actions and turns.
- **Winning Conditions**: Determining the winner and handling game end scenarios.
- **User Interface**: Simple text-based UI to interact with the game.

## Note

This repository is a part of my learning journey, and some files might still be a work in progress or contain experimental code. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
